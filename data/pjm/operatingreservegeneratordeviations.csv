"The reasons below represent a deviation exemption hierarchy.  The indicator statements should be examined starting at the top and proceeding to the bottom of the list.  The first statement that is true for a particular unit and hour indicates whether or not the unit is exempt from devations or not.  No subsequent statements should be evaluated.
Actual Indicator = Y and unit is operating at the request of PJM, deviations will not be incurred.
Operating Reserve Lost Opportunity Cost Eligible = Y, deviations will not be incurred.
Reactive Services Eligible = Y, deviations will not be incurred.
Regulating Indicator = Y, deviations will not be incurred.
Synch Reserve Tier 1 Response Indicator = Y, deviations will not be incurred.
Synch Reserve PJM-Assigned Tier 2 Indicator = Y, deviations will not be incurred.
Min Gen Reduction = Y, deviations will not be incurred.
Hydro Unit Indicator = Y and Within 5% / 5 MWh Deviation Threshold = N, deviations will be incurred
Restricted Limits Indicator = True and Within 5% / 5 MWh Deviation Threshold = N, deviations will be incurred
RT Generation MWh <= 0 and DA Schedule MWh <> 0 and Within 5% / 5 MWh Deviation Threshold = N, deviations will be incurred
Self Scheduled: Max <= 110% Min or Desired Mwh <= Min and Within 5% / 5 MWh Deviation Threshold = N, deviations will be incurred
% Off Dispatch Greater than 10% = Y and Following PJM Dispatch = N and Within 5% / 5 MWh Deviation Threshold = N, devations will be incurred
If none of the above statements are true, deviations will not be incurred."
