Disclaimer: This data is prepared by the PJM Treasury Departments Credit Group and reflects the aggregation of all billed amounts in all existing accounts and subaccounts for the member which is responsible for the account shown. While PJM takes reasonable efforts to ensure this net bill data is accurate inaccuracies may exist. Accordingly this data is to be used by the member only to estimate their expected net bill amount.  If any discrepancies are noted please contact PJMs billing department immediately so that the discrepancy can be investigated and/or corrected. In all cases the individual PJM invoices are the operative billing instruments and take precedent over this report.  Note that a Net Bill amount is inherently a member-level total whereas MSRS reports present data by account.  Accordingly if you as a PJM member have more than one subaccount at PJM then this data is being presented in only one of those accounts.
